A simple program that solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. This project takes a partially filled Sudoku board and automatically fills in the missing numbers while following Sudoku rules.

Features

Solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles.

Validates input boards for correctness.

Displays the solved puzzle in a readable format.

How It Works

The solver uses backtracking, which tries numbers in empty cells and backtracks if a number leads to an invalid board until the puzzle is solved.
